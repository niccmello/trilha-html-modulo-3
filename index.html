            <h1 id="bio">Biography</h1>
            <p>An Ionian of deep resolve, Yasuo is an agile swordsman, trained to wield the air itself against his enemies. As a young man, pride led him down a path of loss, costing him his position, his mentor, and ultimately his own brother. Disgraced by false accusations and now hunted as little more than a criminal, Yasuo wanders his homeland seeking redemption for his past, with only the wind to guide his blade.
                As a child, Yasuo often believed what the others in his village said of him: on the best days, his very existence was an error in judgement; on the worst, he was a mistake that could never be undone.

            <h2 id="life">Early life</h2>
            <p>Yasuo was born in an Ionian village after his father came like an autumn wind into the life of his mother, who was already a widow. His father had left by the time winter settled over the land.

                Yasuo grew up to be very close to his half-brother, Yone Yone. However, in contrast to Yone's respectful and patient personality, Yasuo was often arrogant and impulsive. But after being accepted into the village’s renowned sword school, his determination and talent caught the attention of Elder Souma, the last master of the legendary wind technique. He initially refused the tutelage of Elder Souma, but then Yone gave him a maple seed, symbolizing his plea for Yasuo to show humility. Subsequently, Yasuo accepted the master’s offer and became his apprentice and bodyguard.
                
                Yasuo continued to train in the sword school, and his use of the wind technique made his sparring sessions with Yone a sight to behold.

            <h2 id="invasion">Noxian invasion</h2>
            <p>When news of the Noxian invasion and the Great Stand at Navori reached the school, many of the disciples, including Yone, chose to help defend against the approaching Noxians. Yasuo, however, was ordered to stay back and defend his elders.

                Soon, Yasuo heard drums of a Noxian march and chose to go out and face the enemy, thinking he could turn the tide of the battle. But when he arrived at the battlefield, he found death everywhere. Something unnatural had caused hundreds of Noxians and Ionians to perish.
                
                When Yasuo returned to the school, he found himself surrounded by the remaining students and learned that his master was dead. They accused him of murder, so he fought his way free in the hopes of punishing the true killer.
                
                When Yasuo was tracked down by Yone, they clashed swords, and Yasuo cut down his half-brother, who died before he could grant any absolution.

            <h2 id="appear">Appearance</h2>
            <p>Yasuo appears to be a fairly stocky adult man, fair skin with a scar on his nose, brown eyes with green highlights, back-length hair tied in a ponytail, and has a shadow of a beard.
            his attire consists of a rather torn Ionic samurai-style armor, on his right he has a part of metal armor and the rest is a torn light blue armor that exposes part of his chest, baggy pants, a cloth that covers part of his chest and the face and always carries with him his sword.
